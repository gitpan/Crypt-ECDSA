NAME

Crypt::ECDSA -- Digital Signature using Elliptic Curve Cryptography

LANGUAGE

Perl, with two C routines in XS


DESCRIPTION

ELiiptic curves are believed to allow smaller secure key sizes for currently 
secure algorithms than standard RSA and DSA formulations of public /private 
key cryptography.  This module implements a subset of the DSS algorithm using 
elliptic curve cryptography descibed in the NIST publication FIPS 186-2 (2000).


To install the module...

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
